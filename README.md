<h1>Diary Project</h1>

This is a Laravel project I made to learn the fundamentals of MySQL and Laravel. DinoDiary is a project where people can register and login as a user. Users can create, edit or delete posts from their diaries. Diary posts can be edited with an editor and pictures can also be uploaded to each individual post.

In this project I learned how to implement an authentication system, learned how to implement CRUD operations and learned how to work around Laravel overall.

For forms I used: https://laravelcollective.com/
Editor for posts: https://ckeditor.com/
