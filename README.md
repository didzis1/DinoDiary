DinoDiary project

This is a Laravel project I made to learn the fundamentals of MySQL CRUD operations with Laravel. DinoDiary is a project where people can register and login as a user. Users can create, edit or delete posts from their diaries. Diary posts can be edited with an editor and pictures can also be uploaded to each individual post.

Editor for posts: https://ckeditor.com/
